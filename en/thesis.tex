\frontmatter
\chapter{Abstract}%\label{abstract}
This LaTeX thesis template begins simple and I am going to let it grow and get more complex step by step. I am sharing this template in the form of a Git repository, thus as a reader you can trace back the growth commit by commit. I want to write useful commit messages, so you can take them each time as a short description of what was added.

\mainmatter
\chapter{Let's begin with text}%\label{just_text}
Halli Hallo.
